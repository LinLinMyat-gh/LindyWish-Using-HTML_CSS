# LindyWish

**Overview:**
LindyWish is a project that I worked on during my first year at Rangsit University. It was part of an assignment where the objective was to code an online shopping platform similar to Lazada. I later renamed it to LindyWish and created a display page to showcase the concept of an online shopping website.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS

**Features:**
- This project is a static webpage that displays a basic online shopping layout.
- It includes sections like:
  - Header with branding
  - Navigation menu
  - Product categories
  - Featured products
  - A search bar and cart icon
  - Footer with links to privacy policy, terms of use, and contact us
- The design is optimized for mobile display.

**Note:**
- The project serves as a display page only, created to showcase a potential design for an online shopping platform.
- It does not include any back-end functionality or actual shopping features.
